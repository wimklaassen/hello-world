# hello-world

Hi, I a music lover (that is, Renaissance and Baroque, especially vocal works) and quite comfortable with programming. At the moment, I am looking into Herv√© Bitteurs Audiveris project (music scanning), which had been forked as Libreveris on GitHub. That's a great piece of work, chapeau! I hope I'll be able to contribute to this project.
